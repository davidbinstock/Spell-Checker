# Spell-Checker
### Spell Checker Program Coded in Java

Given a text file (.txt), this program will compare each word against a dictionary file. For any words not found in the dictionary, 
the program will provide a list of suggested alternatives then prompt the user to either:
1) replace the word using one of the suggestions
2) accept the word as is, or
3) type in a correction mannually. 

The program then generates a new text file with the corrected words.
